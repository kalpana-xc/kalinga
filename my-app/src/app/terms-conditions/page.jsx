          <li>Each User accepts and agrees that the provision of details of his/ her use of the Website to regulators or police or to any other third party in order to resolve disputes or complaints which relate to the Website shall be at the absolute discretion of Kalinga University.</li>
          <li>If any part of these Terms and Conditions are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions shall continue in effect.</li>
          <li>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the User and Kalinga University. These Terms and Conditions supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the User and Kalinga University. A printed version of these Terms and Conditions and any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</li>
          <li>The entries in the books of Kalinga University and/or the Payment Service Providers kept in the ordinary course of business of Kalinga University and/or the Payment Service Providers with regard to transactions covered under these Terms and Conditions and matters therein appearing shall be binding on the User and shall be conclusive proof of the genuineness and accuracy of the transaction.</li>
          <li>Server Slow Down/Session Timeout: In case the Website or Payment Service Provider’s webpage, which is linked to the Website, is experiencing any server-related issues like ‘slow down’ or ‘failure’ or ‘session timeout’, the User shall, before initiating the second payment, check whether his/her Bank Account has been debited or not and accordingly resorts to one of the following options:</li>
          <li>In case the Bank Account appears to be debited, ensure that he/ she does not make the payment twice and immediately thereafter contact Kalinga University via e-mail or any other mode of contact as provided by Kalinga University to confirm payment.</li>
          <li>However, the User agrees that under no circumstances shall the Payment Gateway Service Provider be held responsible for such fraudulent/duplicate transactions, and hence no claims should be raised against the Payment Gateway Service Provider.
